_Eagle footprints of electronic components used in EDS projects._

When working on pcb design projects, one might encounter all kinds of components. Some manufacturers make Eagle files available for use; others don't. When you wish to incorporate a part that doesn't have readily available Eagle files available you'll have to create your own Eagle footprint.
